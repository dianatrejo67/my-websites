        <h1>Origins of Music</h1>
    <p style=font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center;">
The origin of music likely stems from pre-historic human ancestors using the voice, clapping, and natural objects for rythmitic communication, bonding, and ritualistic purposes, dating back to potentially over 40,000 to 60,000 yers. It evolved as a "protomusical" launguage to express emotions and bond groups, possibly predating launguage or developing alongside it as a survival tool. </p>

Some styles originated from strong historical reasoning or events, and others simply developed with the change in style and culture as time passed.
