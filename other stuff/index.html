<h1 style="color: blue;">Diana's Winter Adventure</h1>
<p style="color: blue;"> Hi! My name is Diana and Im going to break down my winter break!</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(6, 92, 92);">My Family</h2>
<p style="color: rgb(6, 92, 92);">I have a really big family. During my break I spened time with <em> my parents, my younger sister and my older brother</em>. When it was time for christmas and new years I went to my cousins house where I have <strong> an aunt and an uncle,my godmother and my godfather, my 3 cousins,and my 4 baby cousins </strong>. I love spending time with family because I love being able to seperate myself from school and focus on the people that matter to me.</p>

<h2 style="color: blue;"> The Games I Played</h2>
<p style="color: blue;">During the break I played many games. I played UNO during my aunts christmas party and I played roblox alongside my family. I had so much fun because that bonding time with them meant the world to me</p>

<h2 style="color:  rgb(6, 92, 92);">Food I Ate</h2>
<p style="color:  rgb(6, 92, 92);">I ate a lot of traditional mexican foods. For christmas I ate birria and pozole, I drank coke and I ate gingerbread cookies. For new years I ate enchiladas accompanied with rice and beans.</p>

<h2 style="color: blue;">Me Time</h2>
<p style="color: blue;">As much as I love my family and spending time with them, I really enjoy being alone. This helps me reset and overall make me reflect and enjoy the little things. This also helps me when I am not feeling my best because it helps me feel better. What I love to do when im alone is puuting my airpods in and listening to my favorite songs while doing a wordsearch or doing my nails. I highly reccommend that to everyone!</p>
